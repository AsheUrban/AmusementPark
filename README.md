## Description

_Sometimes, our branching logic can get more complicated. Let's build a website to determine which amusement park ride someone can go on based on their age and height. In the process, we'll learn about using the logical "and" && and "or" || operators, nesting if statements, and the concepts of "truthy" and "falsey". We'll also include polish our website by adding error handling and a button to clear the form and results._
